## Download (Pre-built)

**Don't want to build from source?** Download the latest release:

1. Go to [Releases](../../releases)
2. Download `YouTube-Downloader-v1.0.zip`
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Run `YouTube Downloader.exe`

**Note:** Windows may show a security warning since the app isn't code-signed. Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway" to proceed safely.

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-downloader.git
   cd youtube-downloader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Building the Application

**For Windows:**
```bash
npm run build-win
```

**For macOS:**
```bash
npm run build-mac
```

**For Linux:**
```bash
npm run build-linux
```

The built application will be in the `dist/` folder.

### Using the Built App

After building, you'll find your app in:
- **Windows**: `dist/win-unpacked/YouTube Downloader.exe`
- **macOS**: `dist/mac/YouTube Downloader.app`
- **Linux**: `dist/linux-unpacked/youtube-downloader`

**To distribute:** Zip the entire unpacked folder (not just the .exe file) as it contains all necessary dependencies.

## Project Structure

```
youtube-downloader/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js              # Electron main process
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preload.js          # Preload script for security
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.html            # Main application interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json        # Project configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/               # Built applications (after build)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ win-unpacked/   # Windows build output
```

## How It Works

1. **Frontend**: Clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for user interaction
2. **Backend**: Electron main process handles video downloading using ytdl-core
3. **Security**: Context isolation enabled with preload scripts
4. **Downloads**: Uses `@distube/ytdl-core` library for YouTube video processing

## Scripts

- `npm start` - Run the app in development mode
- `npm run build-win` - Build for Windows
- `npm run build-mac` - Build for macOS  
- `npm run build-linux` - Build for Linux

## Dependencies

### Main Dependencies
- `@distube/ytdl-core` - YouTube video downloading
- `express` - Local server functionality

### Dev Dependencies
- `electron` - Desktop app framework
- `electron-builder` - Application packaging

## Known Issues

- **Windows Security Warning**: Since the app isn't code-signed, Windows Defender may show a warning. This is normal for unsigned applications.
- **Build Errors**: Code signing errors during build can be ignored - they don't affect functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
If you encounter missing module errors when running the built app, the build configuration automatically includes all required dependencies. Try rebuilding:

```bash
rm -rf dist
npm run build-win
```

### Windows won't run the app
1. Right-click the .exe file
2. Select "Properties"
3. Check "Unblock" if the option exists
4. Click "OK" and try again

### YouTube videos won't download
YouTube frequently changes their systems. If downloads fail:
1. Update the dependencies: `npm update`
2. Rebuild the application
3. Try different video URLs to test
